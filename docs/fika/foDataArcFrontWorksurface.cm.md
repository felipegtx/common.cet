## Product Features and Behavior

1. **Arced Front Edge**: The worksurface features a curved front edge, creating an arc that spans 200 degrees. This unique design element distinguishes it from standard rectangular worksurfaces.

2. **Stretchable Front Edge**: The front edge of the worksurface can be adjusted or "stretched" to modify its shape or size. This feature allows for customization to fit specific space requirements or design preferences.

3. **Depth Adjustment**: The depth of the worksurface can be changed using various methods:
   - Stretching the front edge
   - Inserting a new value
   - Dragging the edge to a new position

4. **Lockable Dimensions**: The depth of the worksurface can be locked to prevent accidental changes once set.

5. **Connectivity**: The worksurface can connect with other office furniture pieces, particularly along its sides. There are specific rules for connections near the edges (within 4 inches of either side), which may affect how it interacts with storage units or other worksurfaces.

6. **Mirror Support**: The worksurface has a mirror support feature, which could be useful for symmetrical configurations or specific design layouts.

## Interaction with Other Products

1. The worksurface can connect with other straight-backed worksurfaces along its sides.
2. It may interact with storage units, particularly when considering connections near the edges of the worksurface.
3. The product likely integrates with other FIKA office furniture pieces, though specific details are not provided in the given information.

## Configuration Rules and Constraints

1. The depth must be one of the three specified options (24", 30", or 36").
2. The width must be one of the specified options (18" to 96" in 6" increments).
3. Connections with other furniture pieces are governed by specific rules, especially within 4 inches of either side of the worksurface.
4. The front edge is always curved, forming a 200-degree arc.
5. The arc resolution (smoothness of the curve) is set at 5 degrees, which determines how the curve is rendered or manufactured.

## Remarks and Disclaimers

- The complete structure of the part number has been inferred from the available information and may be subject to change.
- There may be additional features or constraints not evident in the provided information, especially regarding integration with other FIKA office products.
