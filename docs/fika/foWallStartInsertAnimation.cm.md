# FIKA Office Wall Start Insert Animation

This document describes the logic and behavior of the Wall Start Insert Animation for FIKA Office products. This animation is used when placing wall-mounted products in an office environment.

## Product Placement and Wall Alignment

The Wall Start Insert Animation is designed to help users place wall-mounted products correctly in relation to walls in the office space. Its main feature is the ability to align products with wall surfaces, ensuring that wall-mounted products are placed flush against the wall for a neat and professional appearance.

### Alignment Process

1. The animation activates when a user begins to insert a wall-mounted product.
2. As the user moves the mouse, the animation continuously checks for nearby wall surfaces.
3. If a suitable wall surface is detected, the product automatically aligns itself to that surface in real-time.

### Mouse Interaction

The animation responds dynamically to the mouse cursor position:
- Moving closer to a wall triggers the alignment feature.
- Moving away from walls allows for free placement of the product.

### Fallback Behavior

If no suitable wall surface is found, the animation defaults to a standard insertion behavior, ensuring products can still be placed in areas without walls.

## User Experience Considerations

- Simplifies accurate placement of wall-mounted products.
- Reduces need for manual adjustments, improving design workflow.
- Provides real-time visual feedback for product positioning.

## Remarks and Disclaimers

- This documentation covers the general behavior of the Wall Start Insert Animation.
- Specific product dimensions, part numbers, and interaction rules with other products are not covered in this class.
- The exact visual representation may vary depending on the product and office environment settings.
- Additional product-specific rules or constraints may apply during insertion.
