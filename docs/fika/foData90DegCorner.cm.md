# FIKA 90-Degree Corner Worksurface Documentation

## Product Overview

This document describes the configuration logic and part numbering system for the FIKA 90-Degree Corner Worksurface. This product is a corner desk designed to fit in a 90-degree angle, providing a seamless workspace in office environments.

## Dimensions and Part Numbers

The FIKA 90-Degree Corner Worksurface is available in various dimensions, which are reflected in the part number. The part number structure is as follows:

```
FIKA-WS-90-[Width][Depth][Depth]
```

Where:
- `FIKA-WS-90-` is the base part number
- `[Width]` is the width of each side (36 or 42 inches)
- `[Depth]` is the depth of each side (18, 24, or 30 inches)

Here's a table of all valid part numbers for this product:

| Part Number | Width (inches) | Depth (inches) |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| FIKA-WS-90-18363618 | 36 | 18 |
| FIKA-WS-90-18424218 | 42 | 18 |
| FIKA-WS-90-24363624 | 36 | 24 |
| FIKA-WS-90-24424224 | 42 | 24 |
| FIKA-WS-90-30363630 | 36 | 30 |
| FIKA-WS-90-30424230 | 42 | 30 |

These part numbers represent all possible combinations of width and depth for the FIKA 90-Degree Corner Worksurface.

## Product Configuration

### Shape and Orientation

- The worksurface forms a 90-degree angle, suitable for corner installations.
- The product is symmetrical, with equal dimensions on both sides of the corner.

### Edges and Connections

The worksurface has five distinct edges:

1. Right Back (rb): Connects to the wall on the right side
2. Right Side (rs): Forms the outer edge on the right
3. Front (f): The user-facing edge, which is longer and more prominent
4. Left Side (ls): Forms the outer edge on the left
5. Left Back (lb): Connects to the wall on the left side

The front edge is designed with a thicker profile compared to the other edges, providing a more substantial appearance where the user sits.

### Surface Texture

The surface texture is applied uniformly across the worksurface, maintaining consistency in appearance.

### Support Options

The worksurface can be supported by cantilevers in various positions:

- Multiple cantilever positions are available along the back edges (both left and right).
- The number of possible cantilever positions depends on the width of the worksurface.
- Cantilevers are placed at regular intervals, with options for left-handed or right-handed orientation based on their position.

### Stretching and Customization

- The width of the worksurface can be adjusted by stretching the right side (rs) or left side (ls) edges.
- The depth can be modified by adjusting the back edges.
- The front edge cannot be stretched or offset, maintaining its design integrity.

### Mirroring

The product can be mirrored, which is useful for creating symmetrical office layouts. When mirrored, the orientation is adjusted by 90 degrees to maintain the correct positioning.

## Interaction with Other Products

While specific interaction rules with other products are not detailed, the following can be inferred:

- The product is designed to fit into corner spaces, likely interacting with walls or other furniture pieces at its back edges.
- The cantilever support system suggests that it may be used in conjunction with other supporting furniture or structures.

## Remarks and Disclaimers

- The part numbers listed in this document represent all valid configurations for the FIKA 90-Degree Corner Worksurface.
- The cantilever supports are not included in the part number and may need to be ordered separately.
- While the product is described as symmetrical, there may be subtle differences in how the left and right sides are treated in certain scenarios.
- For specific installation instructions or compatibility with other FIKA products, please consult the product installation guide or contact customer support.
- The exact nature of the cantilever supports and their attachment mechanism may require additional documentation.
