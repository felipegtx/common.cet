# FODataNamedFrame Documentation

This document describes the functionality, behavior, and part number structure of the FODataNamedFrame class, which is a specialized panel frame used in office furniture configurations.

## Overview

The FODataNamedFrame is an extension of the AODataSkinFrame class, designed to represent a named panel frame in an office furniture system. It includes features for managing frame types, updating panel names, handling various aspects of the panel's behavior within a space, and generating part numbers.

## Part Number Structure

The part numbers for the FODataNamedFrame follow a specific structure that encodes information about the product type, dimensions, and configuration:

```markdown
| Prefix | Product Type | Dimensions | Configuration |
|--------|--------------|------------|---------------|
| FIKA-  | WS-          | XXXX       | YYYY          |
```

1. **Prefix**: All part numbers start with "FIKA-", which is the product line identifier.
2. **Product Type**: Indicates the specific type of product (e.g., WS for workstation).
3. **Dimensions**: Represents the size of the product, typically in inches.
4. **Configuration**: Additional details about the product's setup or features.

### Example Part Numbers

1. `FIKA-WS-RECT-2424`: Rectangular Workstation, 24" x 24"
2. `FIKA-WS-ARC-3060`: Arc-shaped Workstation, 30" x 60"
3. `FIKA-WS-120-30484830`: 120-degree Workstation, 30" x 48" x 48" x 30"

### Valid Part Numbers

| Product Type | Part Number Pattern | Description |
|--------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Rectangular  | FIKA-WS-RECT-WWDD    | WW: Width (18-96), DD: Depth (18-96) |
| Arc          | FIKA-WS-ARC-WWDD     | WW: Width (24-96), DD: Depth (18-96) |
| 120-degree   | FIKA-WS-120-WWDDDDWW | WW: Width (18-48), DD: Depth (36-48) |

Note: The actual range of dimensions may vary based on product specifications and availability.

## Key Features

1. Frame Type Management
2. Panel Naming
3. Part Number Generation
4. Height and Animation Handling
5. Property Management
6. Space Interaction

## Detailed Functionality

### Frame Type Management

- Each frame has a unique `frameTypeId` that identifies its type.
- The `frameName` is derived from this ID and is used for display purposes.
- The frame type can be reset if needed, removing it from the current world configuration.

### Panel Naming and Part Number Generation

- The panel name and part number are automatically updated when certain properties change or when the panel is moved to a different space.
- The naming system uses a "baptist" mechanism to ensure unique identifiers within the world.
- The `createFikaData` method generates appropriate part numbers based on the frame type, dimensions, and configuration.

### Height and Animation Handling

- When the height of the frame changes, it triggers an update of the panel name and part number.
- After insert animations complete, the panel name and part number are also updated.

### Property Management

- The class manages various properties and responds to changes in these properties.
- It has special handling for nominal height properties, ensuring they align with the available height domain.

### Space Interaction

- The frame interacts with its containing space and can update its configuration based on the space it's in.
- It can check if it's the last frame of its type in the current space.

## Important Methods

- `updatePanelName`: Updates the panel's name and part number based on its current configuration and space.
- `frameKey`: Generates a unique key for the frame, incorporating information from its skins.
- `createPanelJunctionSnapper`: Creates a specialized junction snapper for connecting panels.
- `lastInSpace`: Checks if this frame is the last of its type in the current space.
- `createFikaData`: Generates the appropriate part numbers for the frame.

## User Interface Considerations

- The frame's name, dimensions, and part number are displayed in the main tag text, showing the frame name, width, and height.
- In development mode, the class interacts with a panel manager dialog to update type information.

## Constraints and Rules

- Part numbers are unique for each specific configuration of the FODataNamedFrame.
- The dimensions used in part numbers are always in inches and rounded to the nearest whole number.
- Certain combinations of dimensions may not be valid and will not generate a part number.
- The frame type system relies on a predefined set of frame IDs (`foFrameIds`).
- The naming and identification system is tied to the world and space the frame is in, ensuring consistency across the furniture system.

## Part Number Usage

The part numbers generated by the FODataNamedFrame are used in:

1. Inventory Management
2. Order Processing
3. Assembly Instructions
4. Reporting

## Remarks and Disclaimers

- The exact logic for part number generation is encapsulated within the `createFikaData` method.
- For the most up-to-date list of valid part numbers and their interpretations, please refer to the current product catalog or consult with the inventory management system.
- The functionality related to skins (upSkin and downSkin) is referenced but not fully implemented in this class, suggesting that it relies on parent class implementations or external systems.
