# FIKA Office Junction Documentation

## Product Overview

The FIKA Office Junction is a versatile component used in office furniture configurations. It serves as a connecting point between panels or other office furniture components, allowing for flexible office layouts.

## Part Number Logic

The part number for a FIKA Office Junction follows this structure:

```
FIKA-J-[HEIGHT]-[TYPE]
```

| Component | Description | Possible Values |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| FIKA      | Brand identifier | Always "FIKA" |
| J         | Product identifier for Junction | Always "J" |
| [HEIGHT]  | Height of the junction in inches | 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66, 72, 78, 84, 90, 96 |
| [TYPE]    | Type of junction | E, I, L, T, V, X, Y |

### Valid Part Numbers

| Height | Available Types |
|--------|-----------------|
| 30     | E, L, T, V, X, Y |
| 36     | E, L, T, V, X, Y |
| 42     | E, L, T, V, X, Y |
| 48     | E, L, T, V, X, Y |
| 54     | E, L, T, V, X, Y |
| 60     | E, L, T, V, X, Y |
| 66     | E, L, T, V, X, Y |
| 72     | E, L, T, V, X, Y |
| 78     | E, L, T, V, X, Y |
| 84     | E, L, T, V, X, Y |
| 90     | E, L, T, V, X, Y |
| 96     | E, L, T, V, X, Y |

Note: The 'I' type is listed as "FIKA-J-XX-I" in the provided part numbers, suggesting it might be a special case or placeholder.

### Junction Types Explanation

While exact details are not provided, we can infer the likely shapes based on common office furniture configurations:

- E: Likely an end junction
- I: Possibly an in-line connector (special case)
- L: Likely a 90-degree corner junction
- T: Probably a T-shaped junction for three-way connections
- V: Possibly a variable angle junction
- X: Likely a four-way junction
- Y: Probably a Y-shaped junction for three-way connections at non-right angles

## Dimensions and Positioning

- The junction has a depth (d) set to the value of `cFOFrameDepth`.
- It is positioned within a square area of d x d inches.
- For example, if the depth is 3 inches, the junction would be positioned within a 3x3 inch square.

## Tagging

For identification purposes, a tag is placed on the junction:
- Positioned at the middle of one side of the junction (at coordinates (d, d/2, 0))
- Rotated 90 degrees

## Height Considerations

- The height of the junction can vary from 30 inches to 96 inches in 6-inch increments.
- The system will use the closest valid height when determining the part number.

## Interaction with Other Components

The junction connects panels or other office furniture components. Its various shapes allow it to connect components from different directions and in different configurations.

## Remarks and Disclaimers

- The exact implementation of the `getType()` method, which determines the junction type, is not provided in the given information.
- The actual graphical representation and 3D model of the junction are not defined in this documentation. These aspects might be handled by other components of the system.
- While we've inferred the meanings of the junction types, the exact configurations should be confirmed with product specifications or visual guides.
