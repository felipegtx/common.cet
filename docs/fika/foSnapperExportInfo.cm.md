Since there is no information provided in the "Part Numbers" document, I will consolidate the information from the "Configuration Logic" document while ensuring it's clear and concise. Here's the consolidated documentation:

# FOSnapperExportInfo Documentation

This document describes the functionality and logic of the FOSnapperExportInfo class, which manages the export of product information to CAD systems, particularly AutoCAD.

## Overview

The FOSnapperExportInfo class handles the export of both 2D and 3D product information, including graphical elements, attributes, and part data.

## Key Functionalities

### 1. Export Information Management

- `foExportInfo()`: Retrieves or creates temporary export information.
- `foCreateSnapperExportInfo()`: Creates a new export information object.
- `foDeleteSnapperExportInfo()`: Removes the current export information.

### 2. 2D Export

The `foDwgExportGraphLayers` method:
- Creates a new export information object.
- Builds a 2D representation of the product.
- Processes layers, including text and graphical elements.
- Adds attributes and graphical elements to the export data.
- Adjusts element positions for proper CAD placement.

### 3. 3D Export

The `foDwgExport3DLayers` method:
- Fetches 3D space information of the product.
- Applies rendering settings.
- Adds the 3D primitive to the export data if visible.

### 4. Combined 2D and 3D Export

The `foDwgExport` method:
- Exports 2D information, 3D information, or both, based on parameters.
- Manages export information objects during the process.

### 5. Part Data Export

The `foAppendPartsDataToAutoCADExport` method:
- Processes each part associated with the product.
- Retrieves part-specific information (part number, description, manufacturer, catalog code).
- Adds various attributes to the export data.
- Handles multiple parts by creating new export data objects as needed.

## Part Number Logic

Part numbers (SKU numbers) are retrieved using the `articleCode()` method of the part object. The exact format is not specified in this class.

## Tagging System

- Retrieves part tag categories from the product's space.
- Processes up to three tags (TAG1, TAG2, TAG3) for each part.
- Adds tags to the export data as attributes.

## Export Data Attributes

The class adds several attributes to the export data, including:
- CAPPN: Part Number
- CAPPD: Description
- CAPMG: Manufacturer Code
- CAPMC: Catalogue Code
- CAPQT: Quantity
- L1, L2, L3: Alias tags
- PSEC, PSPN, PSON, PST1, PST2, PST3, PSQT, PSMC: Additional attributes

## Remarks and Disclaimers

1. The exact format of part numbers is not defined in this class.
2. No specific dimension constraints or product-specific rules are specified.
3. The implementation assumes the `AbsPart` class provides methods for retrieving essential product information.
4. The tagging system allows for up to three tags per part.
5. Some information appears to be duplicated in the attribute export.
6. The class doesn't include specific validation rules for the exported data.
