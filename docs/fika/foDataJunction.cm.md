# FIKA Office Junction Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the logic and rules for the FIKA Office Junction, a component used in office furniture configurations. The junction is a connecting element that links different panels or components in the FIKA office system.

## Part Number Logic

The part number for a FIKA Office Junction follows this structure:

```
FIKA-J-[HEIGHT]-[TYPE]
```

Where:
- FIKA-J- is the prefix for all junction components
- [HEIGHT] is the height of the junction in inches
- [TYPE] is a single letter indicating the junction type

### Valid Part Numbers

The following are valid part numbers for FIKA Office Junctions:

| Height (inches) | Available Types |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66, 72, 78, 84, 90, 96 | E, L, T, V, X, Y |

Note: The type 'I' appears in the list as 'XX', which may indicate a placeholder or special case.

Examples of valid part numbers:
- FIKA-J-30-E
- FIKA-J-48-T
- FIKA-J-72-Y

## Junction Types

The single letter at the end of the part number indicates the junction type:

- E: Likely an end cap or termination piece
- L: Probably an L-shaped junction for 90-degree corners
- T: Likely a T-shaped junction for three-way connections
- V: Possibly a variable angle or adjustable junction
- X: Probably a four-way junction for connecting four panels
- Y: Likely a three-way junction with a 120-degree angle between each connection

## Dimensions and Product Rules

1. The junction's depth (d) is fixed and matches the standard FIKA frame depth.
2. The junction's width is equal to its depth, forming a square base.
3. The height of the junction can vary and is determined by the connected panels or components.
4. The junction's 3D representation extends from the ground up to the height specified in the part number.

## Interaction with Other Products

The junction is designed to connect with other FIKA office components. Its square base allows it to join panels or components from different directions, depending on the junction type.

## Positioning and Orientation

1. The main tag is positioned at the middle of one side of the junction, at coordinates (d, d/2, 0), where 'd' is the depth.
2. The main tag is rotated 90 degrees for easy readability when installed.

## Additional Information

1. The junction is part of a modular system, allowing for various configurations based on office layout needs.
2. The height used in the part number is the closest standard height to the actual junction height. This means the part number may not always reflect the exact height of the junction, but rather the nearest standard size.

This documentation provides a clear understanding of the FIKA Office Junction's characteristics, part numbering system, and configuration logic for interior designers and other non-technical users of the FIKA office system.
