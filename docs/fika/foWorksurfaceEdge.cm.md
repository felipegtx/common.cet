# FIKA Office Worksurface Edge and Part Number Documentation

## Introduction

This document describes the logic and behavior of two types of worksurface edges used in FIKA Office furniture: the Standard Edge and the Big Edge. Additionally, it provides detailed information about the part numbering system for FIKA products.

## Standard Edge (FOStdEdge) and Big Edge (FOBigEdge)

### Standard Edge (FOStdEdge)

#### Description

The Standard Edge is a subtle, rounded edge profile that provides a clean and professional look to worksurfaces.

#### Characteristics

- Edge Type: "Std"
- Edge Depth: 1 mm (inward from the worksurface edge)

#### Profile Shape

The Standard Edge has a slightly curved profile:
1. It starts at the top of the worksurface.
2. It curves inward and downward for about 0.075 inches (1.905 mm).
3. It then continues straight down to near the bottom of the worksurface.
4. Finally, it curves back outward to meet the bottom of the worksurface.

This shape provides a smooth, rounded edge that is comfortable to touch and resistant to chipping or damage.

### Big Edge (FOBigEdge)

#### Description

The Big Edge is a more pronounced edge profile that gives worksurfaces a bolder, more substantial appearance.

#### Characteristics

- Edge Type: "Big"
- Edge Depth: 3 mm (inward from the worksurface edge)

#### Profile Shape

The Big Edge has a more dramatic curved profile:
1. It starts at the top of the worksurface.
2. It curves inward and downward for about 0.125 inches (3.175 mm).
3. It then continues straight down to near the bottom of the worksurface.
4. Finally, it curves back outward to meet the bottom of the worksurface.

This shape provides a more noticeable edge treatment that can add visual interest to the worksurface while still maintaining a smooth, comfortable feel.

### Comparison

- The Big Edge is three times deeper than the Standard Edge (3 mm vs. 1 mm).
- The Big Edge has a more pronounced curve at the top and bottom of the profile.
- Both edges provide a smooth transition from the top surface to the edge, avoiding sharp corners.

### Usage Considerations

- The choice between Standard and Big Edge may depend on the overall design aesthetic of the office space.
- The Standard Edge provides a more subtle, traditional look.
- The Big Edge offers a more modern, substantial appearance.
- Both edge types are designed to be comfortable for users and protect the worksurface from damage.

## Part Number Logic

FIKA products use a standardized part numbering system that provides information about the product type, dimensions, and variations. Let's break down the structure of FIKA part numbers:

### Part Number Structure

FIKA part numbers follow this general structure:

```
FIKA-[Product Type]-[Specifications]-[Dimensions]
```

Here's a detailed explanation of each component:

1. **FIKA**: All part numbers start with "FIKA-" to identify the brand.
2. **Product Type**: A code indicating the type of product (e.g., WS for Worksurface, CAB for Cabinet).
3. **Specifications**: Additional details about the product, which may include:
   - Shape (e.g., RECT for Rectangle, ARC for Arced)
   - Configuration (e.g., BBF for Box/Box/File, FF for File/File)
4. **Dimensions**: The size of the product, typically in inches.

### Examples and Explanations

Let's analyze some specific part numbers:

#### Worksurfaces

| Part Number | Product Type | Shape | Width | Depth |
|-------------|--------------|-------|-------|-------|
| FIKA-WS-RECT-2430 | Worksurface | Rectangle | 24" | 30" |
| FIKA-WS-ARC-3060 | Worksurface | Arced | 30" | 60" |

- **FIKA-WS-RECT-2430**: A rectangular worksurface that is 24 inches wide and 30 inches deep.
- **FIKA-WS-ARC-3060**: An arced worksurface that is 30 inches wide and 60 inches deep.

#### Cabinets

| Part Number | Product Type | Configuration | Width | Depth | Height |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|-------|-------|--------|
| FIKA-CAB-BBF-1524 | Cabinet | Box/Box/File | 15" | 24" | (standard) |
| FIKA-CAB-FF-1830 | Cabinet | File/File | 18" | 30" | (standard) |

- **FIKA-CAB-BBF-1524**: A cabinet with two box drawers and one file drawer, 15 inches wide and 24 inches deep.
- **FIKA-CAB-FF-1830**: A cabinet with two file drawers, 18 inches wide and 30 inches deep.

#### Bookshelves

| Part Number | Product Type | Shelf Count | Width | Height |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|-------|--------|
| FIKA-BOOK3-3024 | Bookshelf | 3 shelves | 30" | 24" |
| FIKA-BOOK5-4230 | Bookshelf | 5 shelves | 42" | 30" |

- **FIKA-BOOK3-3024**: A bookshelf with 3 shelves, 30 inches wide and 24 inches high.
- **FIKA-BOOK5-4230**: A bookshelf with 5 shelves, 42 inches wide and 30 inches high.

### Additional Part Number Examples

- **FIKA-OVERHEAD-3614**: An overhead storage unit, 36 inches wide and 14 inches high.
- **FIKA-TILE-3630**: A tile (possibly for dividers or panels), 36 inches wide and 30 inches high.
- **FIKA-TOWER-5FF-1524-L**: A tower unit with 5 file drawers, 15 inches wide, 24 inches deep, left-handed configuration.
