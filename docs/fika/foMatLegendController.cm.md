# FIKA Office Material Legend Controller Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the functionality of the FIKA Office Material Legend Controller, which is responsible for managing material legends in the FIKA Office product line. The controller handles the creation, updating, and management of material legends, which are used to display information about materials used in the office designs.

## Material Legend Creation

The controller creates a specialized type of material legend called FODataMaterialLegend. This legend is specifically designed for the FIKA Office product line and may contain custom information or formatting relevant to FIKA Office materials.

## Adding Materials to the Legend

The system allows for adding materials to the legend through the following process:

1. When a material needs to be added to the legend, the system calls a function to append the material.
2. This function checks if the material can be added and, if so, adds it to a temporary list of materials.
3. If specified, the legend is immediately updated with the new material.

## Legend Management

The controller manages the material legend in the following ways:

1. It can retrieve an existing material legend for a given world (design space) or create a new one if it doesn't exist.
2. Before parts are fetched for the design, the controller clears any temporary material information.
3. After the design is finalized, the controller updates the legends and performs cleanup tasks.

## Legend Updating Process

The legend updating process works as follows:

1. The system checks if there are any new materials in the temporary list.
2. If new materials are found, it updates the material legend for the current design world.
3. After updating, it clears the temporary list of materials.

## Cleanup and Maintenance

The controller performs the following cleanup and maintenance tasks:

1. It clears temporary material information after updating the legend.
2. If no legend parts exist in the design, it removes the auxiliary object (the material legend) from the design world to save resources.

## Integration with Design Process

The material legend controller is integrated into the design process in the following ways:

1. It hooks into the pre-fetch parts stage of the design process to clear temporary materials.
2. It hooks into the post-finalize stage to update legends and perform cleanup.

These integrations ensure that the material legend is always up-to-date with the current design and that unnecessary data is cleaned up when not needed.

## Remarks and Disclaimers

- This documentation focuses on the logic and functionality of the FIKA Office Material Legend Controller and does not include technical implementation details.
- The exact appearance and format of the material legend may depend on other parts of the system not described in this document.
- The behavior described here assumes that the controller is properly initialized and integrated with the rest of the FIKA Office design system.
