# FIKA Office Data Single Picklist Insert Animation

This document describes the functionality of the FIKA Office Data Single Picklist Insert Animation, which is a specialized version of a more general picklist insert animation. This animation is used when inserting a single item from a picklist in the FIKA Office product configuration system.

## Overview

The FIKA Office Data Single Picklist Insert Animation manages the process of inserting a single item from a picklist into the product configuration. It handles the visual feedback during the insertion process and ensures that the correct dialog is shown after the insertion is completed or aborted.

## Key Functionalities

### Aborting the Animation

If the insertion process needs to be cancelled, the system will:

1. Stop the ongoing animation.
2. Display the FIKA Office Data Picklist Dialog, allowing the user to make a different selection or exit the picklist.

### Restoring the Dialog

After the insertion process is completed, the system will:

1. Update the picklist dropdown to reflect any changes.
2. Select the previously chosen item in the picklist.
3. Display the FIKA Office Data Picklist Dialog, allowing the user to review their selection or make additional changes.

## User Interaction

Users may see visual feedback indicating that an item is being inserted into the configuration. If they choose to cancel the insertion, they will be returned to the picklist dialog where they can make a different choice.

Once the insertion is complete, users will see the updated picklist dialog, which will reflect their recent selection. This allows them to confirm their choice or make further modifications to the configuration.

## Impact on Product Configuration

This animation plays a crucial role in the product configuration process by:

1. Providing visual feedback during the insertion of a picklist item.
2. Ensuring that the user interface remains consistent and user-friendly throughout the configuration process.
3. Allowing users to easily cancel an insertion if they change their mind.
4. Updating the picklist to reflect the most recent changes, ensuring that users always see the most up-to-date information.
