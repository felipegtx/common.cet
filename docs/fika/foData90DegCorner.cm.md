# FIKA 90-Degree Corner Worksurface Documentation

## Product Overview

This document describes the logic and rules for the FIKA 90-Degree Corner Worksurface, a specialized desk component designed for office spaces. This corner worksurface is symmetrical and forms a 90-degree angle, making it ideal for creating L-shaped desk configurations.

## Dimensions and Sizing

The FIKA 90-Degree Corner Worksurface is available in the following dimensions:

- Width: 36 inches or 42 inches
- Depth: 18 inches, 24 inches, or 30 inches

These dimensions apply to both sides of the corner, ensuring a symmetrical design.

## Part Number Structure

The part number for this product follows this structure:

```
FIKA-WS-90-[Width][Depth][Depth]
```

Where:
- `FIKA-WS-90-` is the base part number
- `[Width]` is the width in inches (36 or 42)
- `[Depth]` is the depth in inches (18, 24, or 30), repeated twice for symmetry

| Component | Possible Values | Description |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| FIKA-WS-90- | Fixed | Base part number for 90-degree corner worksurface |
| Width | 36, 42 | Width in inches |
| Depth | 18, 24, 30 | Depth in inches (repeated twice) |

Valid part numbers for this product are:

- FIKA-WS-90-18363618
- FIKA-WS-90-24363624
- FIKA-WS-90-30363630
- FIKA-WS-90-18424218
- FIKA-WS-90-24424224
- FIKA-WS-90-30424230

## Product Features and Behavior

### Corner Angle

The worksurface has a fixed 90-degree corner angle, which cannot be altered.

### Surface Texture

The surface of the worksurface can be textured. The texture is applied uniformly across the entire surface.

### Edge Design

The worksurface has different edge types:
- The front edge (facing the user) is thicker than the other edges.
- The left back, right back, left side, and right side edges have a standard thickness.

### Cantilever Support Locations

The worksurface can be supported by cantilevers in various positions:
- Along the left back edge
- Along the right back edge

The number of possible cantilever positions depends on the width of the worksurface. Cantilevers are spaced evenly along these edges, with the positions calculated to ensure proper support.

### Stretching Behavior

The worksurface can be stretched in two ways:
1. When stretching the right or left side, the width of the worksurface changes.
2. When stretching any other edge, the depth of the worksurface changes.

However, the front edge cannot be offset when stretching.

### Mirroring

When mirroring this worksurface, it rotates 90 degrees less than it would normally. This ensures that the mirrored version maintains the correct orientation for a 90-degree corner.

### Item Tag Placement

The main product tag is placed at a 45-degree angle on the surface. This makes it easily visible from multiple angles.

## Interaction with Other Products

The worksurface has connection points on all edges, allowing it to be joined with other desk components:
- Right Back: For connecting to components on the right side
- Right Side: For connecting to components extending from the right
- Front: For connecting to components in front of the worksurface
- Left Side: For connecting to components extending from the left
- Left Back: For connecting to components on the left side

## Remarks and Disclaimers

- The exact measurements for the thick front edge and standard edges are not specified in the given information.
- The specific rules for cantilever placement and the exact spacing between them are not provided in detail.
- The material options and color choices for this worksurface are not mentioned in the given information.
