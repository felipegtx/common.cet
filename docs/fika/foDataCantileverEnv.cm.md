# Cantilever Support Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the logic and rules for configuring cantilever supports in the FIKA Office product line. Cantilever supports are accessories that provide structural support for worksurfaces or other components in office furniture systems.

## Part Number Logic

The part numbers for cantilever supports in the FIKA Office product line follow a specific structure:

```
FIKA-CANTILEVER-[TYPE]
```

Where:
- FIKA: The product line prefix
- CANTILEVER: Indicates it's a cantilever support
- [TYPE]: Specifies the type of cantilever support

Available types and their corresponding part numbers:

| Part Number | Type | Description |
|-------------|------|-------------|
| FIKA-CANTILEVER-DBL | Double | Double cantilever support |
| FIKA-CANTILEVER-LH | Left Hand | Left-hand cantilever support |
| FIKA-CANTILEVER-RH | Right Hand | Right-hand cantilever support |

## Product Configuration

### Accessory Type

The cantilever support is classified as a specific type of accessory within the FIKA Office system, distinguishing it from other types of supports or accessories.

### Generation and Placement

When a cantilever support is needed:

1. The support is generated as a new object in the configuration.
2. It is associated with a parent object, typically a worksurface or another component that requires support.
3. The system determines the appropriate location based on the parent object's characteristics and existing accessories.

### Positioning

Once generated, the cantilever support is positioned as follows:

1. Rotated to align with the parent object.
2. Placed at a specific position relative to the parent object.
3. Assigned a unique key to identify its location.
4. Marked as active, making it visible and functional in the configuration.

### Conflict Resolution

The system checks for conflicts with other accessories or components:

1. Examines the vertical space (Z-axis) occupied by the cantilever support.
2. Checks for overlap in the horizontal plane (X and Y axes).
3. If a conflict is detected, determines which accessory takes precedence based on priority rules.
4. Higher priority accessories may replace lower priority ones if there's a conflict.

### Interaction with Worksurfaces

When a cantilever support is added to a worksurface:

1. The worksurface is notified of the change.
2. This may trigger updates to the worksurface's properties or appearance.

## Dimensions and Constraints

Specific dimensions and constraints for the cantilever support are not provided in the available information. These details would typically include:

- Height range
- Width and depth
- Weight capacity
- Compatible worksurface sizes

For accurate information on these aspects, please refer to the product specifications or consult with the engineering team.

## Remarks and Disclaimers

1. The part number system for cantilever supports is straightforward, with three distinct types available.
2. The configuration logic provided is high-level and may not include all implementation details.
3. For a complete understanding of the cantilever support's capabilities and constraints, additional documentation or access to related product information would be necessary.
4. The actual behavior of the cantilever support in the configuration system may depend on interactions with other components and global settings not visible in this isolated description.
