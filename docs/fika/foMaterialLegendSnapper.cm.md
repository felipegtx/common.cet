# FODataMaterialLegendSnapper Documentation

This document describes the functionality of the FODataMaterialLegendSnapper, which is responsible for creating and managing a material legend in a specific layout.

## Overview

The FODataMaterialLegendSnapper creates a visual representation of material information in a tabular format. It organizes materials by category and displays various attributes such as name, description, ID, and enterprise information.

## Key Features

1. **Material Legend Creation**: Generates a comprehensive legend of materials used in the design.
2. **Categorized Display**: Groups materials by categories for easy reference.
3. **Customizable Columns**: Allows showing or hiding different information columns (name, description, ID, enterprise).
4. **Dynamic Sizing**: Adjusts the legend size based on the content and available space.
5. **Visual Separators**: Uses lines to separate different categories and headers for improved readability.

## Legend Structure

The legend is structured as follows:

1. **Header**: Displays the title of the legend.
2. **Columns**: Can include Name, Description, ID, and Enterprise information (customizable).
3. **Categories**: Materials are grouped by categories, with each category clearly labeled.
4. **Rows**: Each row represents a single material item with its respective information.

## Behavior and Functionality

1. **Legend Generation**:
   - Created based on materials present in the current design.
   - Displays "No options selected" if no materials are present.

2. **Layout**:
   - Adjusts width to accommodate all columns and content.
   - Adds 6 inches padding around the content.
   - Positions header at the top of the legend.
   - Separates categories with horizontal lines.

3. **Column Customization**:
   - Columns can be shown/hidden based on settings:
     - `buildEnv.buildName`: Name column
     - `buildEnv.buildDescription`: Description column
     - `buildEnv.buildID`: ID column
     - `buildEnv.buildEnterprise`: Enterprise column

4. **Category Organization**:
   - Materials sorted and grouped by categories.
   - Each category clearly labeled.

5. **Sizing and Positioning**:
   - Automatically adjusts size based on content.
   - Calculates column widths for content fit and readability.
   - Positions rows dynamically based on material item content.

6. **Visual Elements**:
   - White rectangles as backgrounds for header and content areas.
   - Black lines for category separation and borders.

7. **Updating**:
   - Updates automatically when materials in the design change.
   - Recalculates positions and sizes for new or removed materials.

## Interaction with Other Components

- Interacts with the overall design space to retrieve material information.
- Uses FODataLegendPart to manage legend data and controller interactions.

## Limitations and Considerations

- Legend appearance and behavior may be affected by overall design space and available room.
- Performance may be impacted by a large number of materials or categories.

## Remarks and Disclaimers

- Documentation based on provided class definition; may not cover all use cases or edge scenarios.
- Actual visual appearance may vary depending on rendering engine and display settings of the design software.
