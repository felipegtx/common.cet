## Visual Indicators

### Text Position

The product includes a text indicator for configuration guidance:

- 6 inches to the left of the worksurface's left edge
- 12 inches below the worksurface
- 1 inch above the top surface of the worksurface

The text indicator is not displayed if the worksurface is improperly configured or unrecognized.

### Arrow Position

An arrow indicator guides users during configuration:

1. When connected to another component:
   - For right side or front edge connections:
     - Linear component connections: Arrow at the end of the connection line
     - Other connections: Arrow at the connection point
   - Always 1 inch above the worksurface top surface

2. Not displayed if the worksurface is unconnected or improperly configured

## Interaction with Other Components

The worksurface connects to other office furniture components, primarily at:

- Right side edge (identified as "rs")
- Front edge (identified as "f0")

These connection points enable integration into larger office layouts.

## Dimensions and Measurements

- Depth: 18", 24", or 30"
- Width: Combinations of 36", 42", and 48" (refer to part number table)
- Height: Not specified in part number, but has a measurable top surface height ("worksurfaceTop")

## Remarks and Disclaimers

1. Always refer to the most current product catalog or specification sheet for the complete list of available configurations.

2. Product invalidation rules may be defined in separate validation modules or configuration guidelines.

3. Additional features or constraints may exist in other parts of the system not visible in this documentation.

4. The positioning logic assumes a coordinate system where positive Y is upward and positive X is to the right. Confirm this with full product documentation.

5. Consult the latest product specifications and installation guides for the most accurate and up-to-date information on product features, dimensions, and configuration options.

6. Exact ranges and increments for height adjustments should be specified in separate product documentation.
