# FIKA Office Product Documentation

## Part Number Structure

FIKA Office products use a standardized part numbering system to identify different components and configurations. Understanding this system is crucial for efficient product selection and ordering.

### General Structure

All FIKA Office part numbers follow this general structure:

```
FIKA-[ProductType]-[Specifications]
```

Where:
- `FIKA` is the brand identifier
- `ProductType` indicates the category of the product
- `Specifications` provide details about size, configuration, or other attributes

## Product Categories and Part Numbers

Examples:
- `FIKA-TBL-FSRECT-7242`: Freestanding rectangular table, 72" wide by 42" deep
- `FIKA-TBL-FSROUND-48`: Freestanding round table, 48" diameter

## Edge Types

FIKA Office worksurfaces are available with two types of edges: Standard Edge and Big Edge. These edge types are not reflected in the part number and need to be specified separately when ordering.

### Standard Edge (FOStdEdge)

1. **Identification**: "Std" in the system
2. **Edge Depth**: 1 millimeter (mm)
3. **Profile Shape**: 
   - Curves downward from the top of the worksurface
   - Extends 1 mm out at its deepest point
   - Smooth transition back to the underside of the worksurface

### Big Edge (FOBigEdge)

1. **Identification**: "Big" in the system
2. **Edge Depth**: 3 millimeters (mm)
3. **Profile Shape**: 
   - More pronounced curve from the top of the worksurface
   - Extends 3 mm out at its deepest point
   - More noticeable transition back to the underside of the worksurface

### Comparison and Usage

- The Big Edge is three times deeper than the Standard Edge, providing a more substantial look.
- Choice between edges depends on aesthetic preferences and functional requirements.
- Both edge types offer a smooth, rounded transition from top to bottom.

## Important Notes

1. Not all combinations of dimensions are available for every product type. Refer to the product catalog for valid configurations.

2. When ordering, always use the complete part number to ensure accuracy.

3. Some product types may have additional options or variations not covered in this guide. Consult the full product documentation for more detailed information.

4. The edge type (Standard or Big) must be specified separately when ordering, as it's not included in the part number.

5. The exact thickness of the worksurface (referred to as `foWsThickness` in the system) is not specified in the provided information. This thickness would affect the overall dimensions of the edge profile.

6. Consider both visual impact and practical implications (such as cleaning or durability) when selecting an edge type.

By understanding this part numbering system and edge options, Interior Designers can easily identify and specify the exact FIKA Office products needed for their projects.
