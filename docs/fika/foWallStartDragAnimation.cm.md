# Wall Start Drag Animation Documentation

This document describes the behavior and logic of the Wall Start Drag Animation functionality for interior designers. This feature handles the animation and positioning of wall elements during the dragging process in the design space.

## Overview

The Wall Start Drag Animation occurs when you start dragging a wall element in your design. It manages the positioning, rotation, and snapping of the wall element as you move it around the space.

## Key Features

### Wall Alignment

The animation includes a wall alignment feature that helps position the wall element correctly in relation to other surfaces in the design space.

### Main Position and Rotation

- The wall element's position is continuously updated based on mouse movement.
- The system calculates the best position, considering whether you're in 2D or 3D view.
- The initial rotation is set based on the wall's original orientation in the design space.

### Snapping Behavior

1. The system checks if snapping should be allowed or skipped.
2. If allowed, it searches for suitable snap points.
3. If a valid snap point is found, the wall element automatically aligns to it.
4. If no valid snap point is found, the wall element returns to its previous position.

### Vessel Updates

The animation updates "vessels" (helper objects or visual aids) that assist during the wall placement process. These helpers may become active or inactive depending on successful snapping.

### Continuous Updates

The system continuously updates the wall element's position, checks for snap points, and refreshes the visual display for a smooth dragging experience.

### Properties Synchronization

The animation keeps track of various wall element properties and ensures they are synchronized with its visual representation.

## Remarks and Disclaimers

- This documentation focuses on the logical behavior of the Wall Start Drag Animation.
- The exact visual representation may vary depending on the user interface and graphics capabilities of the design software.
- Specific rules for wall placement and snapping may be influenced by other components of the design system not covered in this document.
