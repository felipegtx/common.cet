## Remarks and Disclaimers

1. The exact measurements for each height option (e.g., "One High", "Two High") are not specified in the given information. It's assumed that these are standard heights within the FIKA office furniture system.

2. While the cabinet is categorized under "Lower Storage", it's worth noting that it can be configured up to "Six High". The term "Lower" might refer to its base configuration or its primary intended use.

3. The configuration system uses imperial measurements (inches) for width and depth. It's important to ensure that any space planning or layout design takes this into account, especially in regions that primarily use metric measurements.

4. When integrating this cabinet with other furniture pieces in the FIKA office line, consult additional documentation or guidelines for potential interactions or constraints.

5. The part number structure provided in this document supersedes any previously mentioned formats (such as "FIKA-CAB-LAT") and should be used for all configurations of the FIKA Office Lateral Cabinet.
