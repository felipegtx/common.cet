Here's the consolidated document that combines the information from both sources while removing redundancies and maintaining clarity:

# FIKA Office Shelf Documentation

## Product Overview

This document describes the configuration logic and part number structure for the FIKA Office Shelf, a wall-mounted shelf designed for office environments.

## Dimensions

The FIKA Office Shelf is available in the following dimensions:

- **Width**: 24", 30", 36", 42", 48", 54", or 60"
- **Depth**: 9"
- **Height**: 4"

The default width for this shelf is 30 inches.

## Part Number Structure

The part number for the FIKA Office Shelf follows this format:

```
FIKA-SHELF-[Width in inches][Depth in inches]
```

Here's a table explaining the structure of the part number:

| Component | Description | Possible Values |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| FIKA      | Brand identifier | Always "FIKA" |
| SHELF     | Product type | Always "SHELF" |
| Width     | Width in inches | 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60 |
| Depth     | Depth in inches | Always 09 |

Valid part numbers for the FIKA Office Shelf are:

- FIKA-SHELF-2409
- FIKA-SHELF-3009
- FIKA-SHELF-3609
- FIKA-SHELF-4209
- FIKA-SHELF-4809
- FIKA-SHELF-5409
- FIKA-SHELF-6009

For example:
- A shelf that is 30 inches wide and 9 inches deep would have the part number: `FIKA-SHELF-3009`
- A shelf that is 48 inches wide and 9 inches deep would have the part number: `FIKA-SHELF-4809`

## Placement and Interaction

The FIKA Office Shelf is designed to be wall-mounted. When placing the shelf in a design:

1. The shelf will be positioned at a specific elevation on the wall. This elevation is predetermined and consistent for all shelves of this type.
2. The shelf can be snapped into place using connectors. When snapped, the shelf will automatically adjust its position to align properly with other elements in the design.
3. After snapping, the shelf's data will be synchronized to ensure all information is up-to-date and consistent with its new position.

## Configuration Rules and Constraints

1. **Width Selection**: Users can choose from the predefined width options (24", 30", 36", 42", 48", 54", or 60"). No custom widths are allowed.
2. **Depth and Height**: The depth (9") and height (4") are fixed and cannot be changed.
3. **Wall Mounting**: This shelf must be mounted on a wall and cannot be freestanding.
4. **Elevation**: The shelf will be placed at a specific height on the wall, which is consistent for all shelves of this type.

## Interaction with Other Products

The FIKA Office Shelf is designed to work within the FIKA office system. While specific interactions with other products are not detailed in this document, it's important to note:

1. The shelf can be snapped into place, suggesting it may interact with other wall-mounted elements or support systems.
2. Its consistent elevation implies it may be part of a larger shelving or storage system designed to work at specific heights.

## Additional Notes

- The shelf's data is synchronized after snapping, ensuring that all related components or systems are updated with the shelf's final position and configuration.
- The graphical representation of the shelf in design software will be positioned based on its elevation, allowing for accurate visualization in office layouts.

## Remarks and Disclaimers

- This documentation is based on the provided information. There may be additional rules, constraints, or interactions defined in other related configuration files that are not captured here.
- The exact elevation at which the shelf is mounted is not specified. This information may be defined elsewhere in the system or may be a standard value known to the design team.
- The snapping behavior and its implications on shelf placement may have more nuanced rules that are not fully captured in this document.
