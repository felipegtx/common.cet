# FODataRemoveAccessoriesVessel Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the functionality of the FODataRemoveAccessoriesVessel, which is responsible for removing accessories from worksurfaces in an office environment. This vessel extends the capabilities of the RemoveAccessoryVessel to handle multiple worksurfaces based on different spread options.

## Spread Options

The vessel operates based on different spread options, which determine how accessories are removed from worksurfaces:

1. **No Spread**: Removes accessories only from the selected worksurface.
2. **Sideways**: Removes accessories from the selected worksurface and its connected neighbors.
3. **Group**: Removes accessories from all worksurfaces in the same connected group.
4. **All**: Removes accessories from all worksurfaces in the main space.

## Functionality

### Removing Accessories

When the user initiates the removal action:

1. The system checks the current spread option.
2. If there's no spread, it removes accessories only from the selected worksurface.
3. For other spread options, it identifies the relevant worksurfaces based on the spread type.
4. For each identified worksurface, the system removes all accessories attached to it.
5. After removal, the system updates the visual representation of the worksurfaces.

### Identifying Relevant Worksurfaces

The system determines which worksurfaces to include based on the spread option:

- For **Sideways** spread: It includes the selected worksurface and all its directly and indirectly connected neighbors.
- For **Group** spread: It includes all worksurfaces that are connected in the same group as the selected worksurface.
- For **All** spread: It includes every worksurface in the main space.

### Visual Representation

The vessel provides both 2D and 3D visual representations to help users understand which worksurfaces are affected:

#### 2D Representation:
- Displays the shape of each affected worksurface.
- Uses a reddish color (RGB: 192, 64, 64) to highlight the affected areas.
- If no worksurfaces are affected, it shows a small circle at the cursor position.

#### 3D Representation:
- Places a red arrow on top of each affected worksurface.
- Highlights the frame of each affected worksurface in bright red.
- If no worksurfaces are affected, it displays a gray arrow at the cursor position.

## Interaction with Other Products

This vessel interacts primarily with worksurfaces and their accessories. It does not directly affect other types of office furniture or equipment.

## Constraints and Rules

- The removal action only applies to accessories that are attached to worksurfaces.
- The spread option determines the scope of the removal action, ranging from a single worksurface to all worksurfaces in the space.
- Connected worksurfaces are treated as a group when using the "Group" spread option.

## Remarks and Disclaimers

- This documentation assumes that the concept of "accessories" and "worksurfaces" is understood by the reader. These terms refer to additional items that can be attached to work surfaces (like desks or tables) in an office environment.
- The exact nature and types of accessories that can be removed are not specified in the provided code and may depend on other parts of the system.
- The visual representations (2D and 3D) are approximations and may not reflect the exact appearance in the final product.
