- Variable Options: Some product lines, like panel fabrics (PF), offer a wide range of size options.

## Dimension Display Functionality

FIKA products feature a dimension display system that provides visual dimension information in both 2D and 3D views.

### Key Features

1. Displays dimension information for specific product properties
2. Automatically updates when product changes
3. Provides both 2D and 3D representations

### 3D Representation

- Dimension text is displayed near the center of the product
- Text orientation adjusts based on camera angle for readability
- For products with height, text is positioned slightly above half the height

### 2D Representation

- Dimension text is positioned to the left of the product's center
- Text size adjusts based on the current view scale

### Visibility

Dimension information is only visible when:
1. The associated product exists
2. The dimension value can be retrieved
3. The product is selected or part of an active animation

### Appearance

- Dimension text is always displayed in black for optimal visibility

## Using This Information in Your Design Process

1. Start by identifying the product type you need (e.g., CAB for cabinet, WS for workstation).
2. Consider the specific configuration or shape required for your design.
3. Determine the dimensions that fit your space.
4. Check if any additional options (like orientation) are needed.
5. Use the part number system to accurately specify products in your designs.
6. Utilize the dimension display functionality in 2D and 3D views to visualize and communicate product sizes effectively.

By understanding both the part number system and the dimension display functionality, you can efficiently specify, visualize, and communicate FIKA product choices in your interior design projects.
